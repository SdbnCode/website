In this project we want to be able to get as close as possible to the web page design given to us by The Odin Project. 
It does not have to be exact but we want to try out best to get as close as possible.

Learning outcomes:
1. Be able to implement flexboxes correctly.
2. Use resources correctly.
3. No cheating! Take your time to figure the code out.
